# Module 1 Final Project Specifications

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 1. 

## Objectives

* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 1
* Understand all required deliverables
* Understand what constitutes a successful project


### Final Project Summary

You've made it all the way through the first module of this course--take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

All that remains for Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project!

### The Dataset

For this project, you'll be working with the [King County House Sales Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/swathiachath/kc-housesales-data).   You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the Sales price of house as accurately as possible. 

### The Deliverables

There will be two main deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented jupyter notebook containing any code you've written for this project.  

2. A short PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation giving a high-level overview of your methodology and findings.

### Technical Report Must-Haves

For this project, your jupyter notebook should meet the following specifications:

#### Organization/Code Cleanliness

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code is commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation   
<br>
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings. 

#### Visualizations & EDA

* Your project contains at least 4 _meaningful_ data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  
<br>  
* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and aswer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labled and easy to identify inside the notebook. 
    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   
<br>      
* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project through the OSEMiN framework. 
    
#### Model Quality/Approach

* Your model should not include and predictors with p-values greater than the .05.  
<br>
* Your notebook shows an iterative approach to modeling, and details the parameters and results of the model at each iteration.  
    * **Level Up**: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.  
<br>     
* You provide at least 1 paragraph explaining your final model.   
<br>  
* You pick at least 3 coefficients from your final model and explain their impact on the price of a house in this dataset.   



### Non-Technical Presentation Must-Haves

The second deliverable should be a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation detailing the results of your project.  Your target audience is non-technical people interested in using your findings to maximize their profit when selling their home. 

Your presentation should:

* Contain between 5 - 10 professional-quality slides.  

    * **Level Up**: The slides should use visualizations whenever possible, and avoid walls of text. 
<br>  
* Take no more than 5 minutes to present.   
<br>
* Avoid technical jargon and explain the results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.   

**_Your presentation should contain at least 2 concrete recommendations for how to improve the selling price of a home._**
