    "# Module 1 Final Project Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 1\n",
    "* Understand all required deliverables\n",
    "* Understand what constitutes a successful project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You've made it all the way through the first module of this course--take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness! \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='awesome.gif'>\n",
    "\n",
    "All that remains for Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll be working with the King County Housesales dataset from Kaggle. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging.  The dataset can be found in the file `\"kc_house_data.csv\"`, in this repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the Sales price of house as accurately as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be two main deliverables for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A well documented jupyter notebook containing any code you've written for this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A short PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation giving a high-level overview of your methodology and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Report Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, your jupyter notebook should meet the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organization/Code Cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code is commented where appropriate.  \n",
    "    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizations & EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your project contains at least 4 _meaningful_ data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and aswer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labled and easy to identify inside the notebook. \n",
    "    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   \n",
    "<br>      \n",
    "* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project through the OSEMiN framework. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Model Quality/Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your model should not include and predictors with p-values greater than the .05.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Your notebook shows an iterative approach to modeling, and details the parameters and results of the model at each iteration.  \n",
    "    * **Level Up**: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.  \n",
    "<br>     \n",
    "* You provide at least 1 paragraph explaining your final model.   \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "* You pick at least 3 coefficients from your final model and explain their impact on the price of a house in this dataset.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Technical Presentation Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "The second deliverable should be a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation detailing the results of your project.  Your target audience is non-technical people interested in using your findings to maximize their profit when selling their home. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contain between 5 - 10 professional-quality slides.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Level Up**: The slides should use visualizations whenever possible, and avoid walls of text. \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "* Take no more than 5 minutes to present.   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Avoid technical jargon and explain the results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Your presentation should contain at least 2 concrete recommendations for how to improve the selling price of a home._**"
